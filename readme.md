# Team Banana - Network Visualizer
#### Required Packages:
```
PyQt5==5.13.2
networkx==2.4
pyvis==0.1.7.0
QDarkStyle==2.7
PyQtWebEngine==5.13.2
```
#### Recommended Installation Process:
##### Unix / MacOS:
We recommend installing the packages under a virtual environment using VENV. There is one included in the repository.

To activate the VENV use:
```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

If you still need to install the packages you can try installing them globally using our install script:
```
./installer.sh
```
Alternatively you can run pip3 on the requirements.txt file:
```
pip3 install -r "./requirements.txt"
```
As a last resort you can open the requirements.txt and install each package manually.

### How to run:
In order to run the visualizer simply use the python3 command below:
```
python3 main.py
```
