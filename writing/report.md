 1. Main Idea where the questions-in-blue from the assignment sheet are generally satisfied.
   Our team would like to take what we learned about graph theory, specifically the directional network graphs and create an interactive program to map out networks. The program would be able to take input in the form of a file read in or direct user input and show the information in a 2D map or in an array style display. We plan to use matplotlib, networkx, and possibly Tkinter for a user interface. The program would be useful for mapping out complex networks, roads, or even as a flight planner. There are many ways in which the program could be applied. Each node in the network is it's own discrete structure with it's own properties. When the user would click on a node the information about that node would be displayed, in the case of the program being used to map out a flight plan it could show information about the airport, prices of the flights, etc. We will learn a lot about how to work with Tkinter, assuming we go that route, and ui/ux in general. We will also have to find a good format to read information in from files and how to allow users to enter information directly into the program with ease. Another challenge would be saving and exporting maps and information. There is a lot of learning to be done here!
