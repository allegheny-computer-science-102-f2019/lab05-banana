# Starter Files

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for the Lab.

## Introduction

This lab is to be completed using groups and concerns two parts. The first part is to write Python code to compute an existing truth table (shown in the lab assignment sheet) and the second part is to create new data to be applied to an original truth table to determine some decision.


## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review class slides and read assigned Chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the teaching assistants or tutors if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.


## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with either the course instructor or a teaching assistant during the practical session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
